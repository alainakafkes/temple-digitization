# Digitization of Shape Poetry in _The Temple_ by George Herbert

### About

As a past [Kaplan Scholar](http://www.humanities.northwestern.edu/kaplan-humanities-scholars-program/) at Northwestern, I brought my education full circle by taking [Humanities 325 (Technologies of Language)](http://www.northwestern.edu/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HUM/325-6/24202.html) in winter 2017. In this class, we discussed the philosophy of language, and, much to my enjoyment, got to tackle digitization of an old book of our choice. I chose Herbert's _The Temple_ because I saw digitizing shape poetry as an interesting design challenge. How could I recreate the original experience of reading a book of shape poems online? This repository reflects my exploration of and efforts to answer this question.
